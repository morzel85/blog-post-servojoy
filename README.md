This is sample code for blog post!
==================

Read the post on CodeProject: http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/839229/OoB-Moving-webcam-with-joystick-and-servos-Arduino or on my blog: http://en.morzel.net/post/2014/10/23/OoB-Moving-webcam-with-joystick-and-servos-(ArduinoSharpDXWinForms).aspx

##### Dependencies: 
This project is using *SharpDX* and *SharpDX.DirectInput* NuGet packages.
These are not included in the repository to save space but Visual Studio should download them automatically upon first build (my VS Express 2013 for Windows Desktop does it without any problems).
